# music player

This is hopefully not the final name.

A music player that is planned to be cross platform with a built in visualizer. I'm making this because I don't like the one that comes with windows.

### how to use
Clone/download the repository. `npm -i` to install the dependencies. When that's finished, run `npm start` and the application will start.

You'll also need to edit app/index.html. Change the src in the audio element to a path to some song.

Eventually I'll make it easier (installers and such) to run.
